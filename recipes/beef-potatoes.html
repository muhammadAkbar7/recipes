    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol type="1"> 
        <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add beef, cumin, salt and pepper; cook, stirring often to break up the meat, until evenly browned, about 6 minutes. 
            Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beef to a paper-towel-lined plate; do not wipe out the pan. Add 1 tablespoon oil to the drippings in the pan. 
            Add potatoes; cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes begin to caramelize and are tender, about 20 minutes. 
            Transfer the potatoes to the plate with the beef. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the skillet over medium heat. 
            Add onion, bell pepper and poblano; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 6 minutes. 
            Add garlic; cook, stirring often, until aromatic, about 1 minute. 
            Add kale and tomatoes; cook, stirring often, until the kale is wilted and the tomatoes are heated through, about 3 minutes. 
            Stir in the beef and potatoes. Sprinkle with sliced scallions, if desired.

    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>
        This is the perfect meal for lunch. The pasta is good energy for a workout and the chicken
        will help with needed protein intake. The seasonings add a hint of extra taste while keeping
        it reasonably light.
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul> 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed </ul>
    <ul> 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided </ul>
    <ul> 1 tablespoon chili powder </ul>
    <ul> 2 teaspoons ground cumin </ul>
    <ul> ½ teaspoon ground chipotle </ul>
    <ul> ¾ teaspoon salt, divided </ul>
    <ul> 1 medium red bell pepper, thinly sliced then halved crosswise </ul>
    <ul> 1 medium yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced then halved crosswise </ul>
    <ul> 1 medium onion, halved and sliced </ul>
    <ul> 8 ounces whole-wheat penne </ul>
    <ul> 2 tablespoons lime juice </ul>
    <ul> ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro </ul>
    <ul> Pico de gallo and/or sour cream for serving </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol type="1"> 
        <li> Preheat oven to 400°F. Coat a large rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. </li>
        <li> Slice chicken crosswise into strips. Combine 2 tablespoons oil, chili powder, cumin, chipotle and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. 
            Add the chicken and stir to coat with the spice mixture. Add bell peppers and onion; stir to combine. 
            Spread the chicken and vegetables in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. 
        </li>
        <li> Roast on the middle rack for 15 minutes. Leave the pan there and turn the broiler to high. 
            Broil until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are browning in spots, about 5 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add penne and cook according to package directions; drain. 
            Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, lime juice and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in the saucepan. Add the chicken mixture and the pasta; stir to coat. 
            Sprinkle with cilantro and stir again to combine. Serve with pico de gallo and sour cream, if desired. 
        </li>
